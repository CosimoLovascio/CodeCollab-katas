# Kata 1 - GildedRose
Based on [this](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python), the code refactoring
has been performed following these steps:
1. implemented the test cases of the current working implementation (GildedRose class)
2. explored corner cases
3. extended GildedRose with GildedRoseV2, adding the new functionalities 
(as described [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.txt))
4. added new test cases to test the new functionalities
5. added tests for GildedRoseV2, using old and new test cases together
